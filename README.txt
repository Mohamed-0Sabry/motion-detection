to make the app work you should install the librarys that i use in the code you would find it on google.
after installing the libraries run the code if you want to close just press (SPACE) on the keyboard
the app works as the next : 
first the camera takes a photo and this photo called the original the app starts to take a photo every frame and compare this frames to the first photo (original), if there is any changes the app suppose this changes as movment objects
